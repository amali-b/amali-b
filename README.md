# Hi there 👋, I'm Amali Abeysekera

As a BIT undergraduate at UCSC, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on industry experience while working as a Senior Associate (Production). 
Over the past 3+ years, I’ve worked across diverse sectors, including **Banking and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)**, which has allowed me to collaborate with multicultural teams and develop a strong foundation in professional communication, adaptability, and teamwork.

My journey so far has helped me grow both personally and professionally, while reinforcing my passion for working in dynamic, fast-paced environments.

I am currently learning React and Tailwind CSS to create beautiful web applications.My goal is to leverage my technical expertise and proven track record to contribute to innovative software development teams.
