## Hey, I am Amali! üëã

As a BIT undergraduate at UCSC, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on industry experience while working as a Senior Associate (Production). 
Over the past 3+ years, I‚Äôve worked across diverse sectors, including **Banking and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)**, which has allowed me to collaborate with multicultural teams and develop a strong foundation in professional communication, adaptability, and teamwork.

My journey so far has helped me grow both personally and professionally, while reinforcing my passion for working in dynamic, fast-paced environments.
